## Getting the aarch64-elf bare-metal GNU Toolchain

I've created an image with the aarch64-toolchain. All labs use it. To get it:

```bash
docker pull rromanotero/aarch64
```

## Compiling this Lab on Windows
##### ( Docker Windows requires the FULL PATH TO THE LAB FOLDER to bind mount it)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rromanotero/computer_architecture_labs.git
cd computer_architecture_labs
docker run `
       -v C:\...\LAB_FOLDER:/src `
       rromanotero/aarch64 `
       bash -c "cd src && make"
```   

## Compiling this Lab on Linux/Mac
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rromanotero/computer_architecture_labs.git
cd computer_architecture_labs
docker run \
       -v ./LAB_FOLDER:/src \
       rromanotero/aarch64 \
       bash -c "cd src && make"
```

## Running Labs in QEMU

All labs have been tested with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/). The format is

#### Windows
```bash
qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel .\LAB_DIRECTORY\output kernel8.img POSSIBLY_MORE_PARAMS_HERE
```

#### Linux
```bash
qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel ./LAB_DIRECTORY/output kernel8.img POSSIBLY_MORE_PARAMS_HERE
```

**The exact command for every lab is on it's README**

## Running Labs in a PI 3

You'll need a Raspberry PI 3 MOdel A+, a [USB to UART converter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954), [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), and the boot files from [Raspbian Buster Lite image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

1. Get an SDCard with [Raspbian Buster Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) installed on it (see [installation instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md))
2. replace **kernel8.img in the boot partition of the SDCard** (you'll see it when reading the PI's SDCard from a laptop) with ./output/kernel8.img.
3. Insert back the SD Card onto the PI
4. Install the USB to UART converter drivers (if you're using the one from Adafruit, they also have a tutorial on how to install drivers)
5. Plug the PI's UART to yout laptop (via the converter), and access the PI from PuTTY:
